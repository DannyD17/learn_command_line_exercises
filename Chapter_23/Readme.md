#Do More

For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.

Here's the list for Unix:

`xargs` builds and executes command lines from the standard input

`sudo` Super user do, allows commands to be executed as a superuser

`chmod` Changes access permissions to file system objects

`chown` The chown utility changes the user ID and/or the group ID of the specified files.
