> Explain what the |, <, > and >> commands do in your own words in the Readme.md

The | or "pipe" takes the command that is to the left of the pipe and runs it (directs it) into the command on the right

What is on the lefthand side of the < will recieve input from what is on the right hand side.

For the > symble, whatever the output from the left side of the > will write to the file on the right hand side

If you want to append a file use the >> symble.  This will take whatever output from the left side of the >> and write it to the file on the right side.
