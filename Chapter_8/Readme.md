The commands pushd and popd and another way of navigating through directories, though they do it in a slightly
different mannor then the cd command.  pushd "pushes" or stores the current working directory into a list to be 
used later and temperally changes your working directory.  An example of this would be

> pushd /tmp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex

This will store the current directory (In this example I am working in Chapter_8 directory) and move you to alex.

The command popd will take the last directory that was pushed and moves pops it off the list and changes to that directory.


Do More

> In the do more section I went to a number of directories. I practices pushd and popd at various levels of the tmp
directories.  I ran pushd /tmp/stuff/things/frank/joe/alex and and jumped around the different directories in stuff.  
Additionally I moved through the i/like/icecream directories and popd back to the davinci class directory.
