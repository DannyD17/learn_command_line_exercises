Can you output all the txt files in this directory?

>You can output the text with either the command cat or less:
    
    Daniels-MacBook-Pro:Chapter_16 $ less *.txt
    
    Daniels-MacBook-Pro:Chapter_16 $ cat *.txt
    Hello
    Hello
    This is some text

Show me the content of the text files in slash temp.

    Daniels-MacBook-Pro:tmp $ pwd
    /tmp
    
    Daniels-MacBook-Pro:tmp $ cat *.txt
    Hello! how are you?
    some other random stuff
    This is a test file
    
    Daniels-MacBook-Pro:tmp $ ls *.txt
    hello.txt  random.txt test.txt
